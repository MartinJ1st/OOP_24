//Write a program that from a file will read a string (not longer than 100 characters) containing letters and digits.
// The program should print on the standard output the letters that are between the first and the second digit,
// left-to-right, including the bordering digits themselves. If there is only one digit in the string, the program
// should print all the letters till the end of the string. If there is no digits in the string the program should
// print out the message "No digits".
