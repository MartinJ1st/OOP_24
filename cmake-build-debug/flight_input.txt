Did you enjoy the concert however find the sound quality lacking
Are you going to the beach but bringing a jacket just in case it gets chilly
Did she finish her project on time although she had many obstacles along the way
Have you tried the new restaurant downtown but found the service slow
Do you like reading mystery novels however prefer fantasy books more
Were they able to fix the problem although it took longer than expected
Have you seen the latest movie but thought the plot was too predictable
Is he attending the meeting however feeling unprepared
Did you visit the museum but miss the special exhibit
Were you able to catch the bus although it was running late
END
